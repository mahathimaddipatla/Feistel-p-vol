# ***Feistel-p-vol***

### Overview
*Feistel-p-vol* is a console-based application inspired by the encryption techniques depicted in the series "Money Heist". It offers a method for encrypted communication using the Feistel cipher, providing users with the ability to both encrypt and decrypt their data.

The name *"Feistel-p-vol"* derives from the Feistel cipher utilized in the project. 'p' represents the reference to the professor, and 'vol' signifies the heist scenario akin to the series, where advanced encrypted communication is pivotal.

### Features

* **Encryption/Decryption:** Users can encrypt their data and subsequently decrypt it using the same sequence of keys.

* **Secure Communication:** The project showcases a secure method of communication, where data undergoes encryption using a series of keys. It supports encryption for up to 10,000 lines, employing a maximum of 10,000 keys. Note: The number of lines encrypted should be aligned with the system's CPU power for correct output.

### Getting Started
* To use Feistel-p-vol locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
* git clone https://github.com/AK0206/Feistel-p-vol.git

### Navigate to the project directory:
* Feistel-p-vol >> src >> feistel >> MainClass
* Note: Before running the MainClass, run the keys file once in order to generate keys.
* Run the console application.

### Usage
* Launch the console application.
* Select the option to encrypt or decrypt data.
* Input the data you want to encrypt/decrypt.
* Follow the prompts to proceed with encryption/decryption using the sequence of keys.

### Limitations
* Ensure the number of lines encrypted aligns with your CPU power for accurate results.
* Encrypting large volumes of data may impact performance.
